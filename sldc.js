// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "During this second step, it is determined which structures and technologies are required to build and run the software.";

const design = "Next, development teams create an outline for how the code will function. It is decided before hand how the code will be structured and what will need to be included.";

const implementation = "This is the coding part. Here developers begin creating what was layed out in the design stage.";

const testingAndIntegration = "Here, developers check to make sure each section of code works. They also attach it to any existing code, infastructure, or technologies and make sure they all function together correctly.";

const maintain = "Lastly, the developers continually ensure that the code continues to work, especially as the technologies and systems it was integrated into are updated.";
